# Pull Requests

## Description
### Task Lists
Task lists are lists of checkboxes, written in Markdown. We typically use them as a lightweight mechanism to list the things that need to be done before a PR is ready for review, or ready to merge. If a task list exists in a PR description, the PR cannot be merged until every task has been marked as completed or not applicable.

- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] ~~Task that's only relevant to frontend PRs~~ N/A _backend only change_

See [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists#about-task-lists) for further information on how to use task lists.

Documentation on the task list checker can be found [here](https://github.com/Shopify/task-list-checker/blob/main/README.md#in-a-pull-request).
